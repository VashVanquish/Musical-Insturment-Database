# Musical-Insturment-Database
A web application for the inventory, employees, and customers accounts of a fictitious Musical Instrument Store. Contributors include Samuel Kim, Mason Lanham, and Jeff Xie.
Requires deployment to a webserver to run properly. I used Apache Tomcat 8.0 connected to my Eclipse Java Enterprise edition to run it.
